## Technologies

This application uses the MERN stack and the following technologies:

- React and CSS library Bootstrap on the front end for component rendering and styles
- MongoDB database for storing all user data
- JWT authentication
- GraphQL and Apollo Server Express for interacting with our database
- OMDb third-party API for retrieving all movie data
- Deployed via Heroku and MongoDB Atlas

## Usage

When used in the browser, a user can search any movie by title, with search results appearing as they type. The user can access a movie's profile by clicking "View" to see more information about the film. In order to add a film to their watchlist, the user must sign up or log in. Once logged in, clicking "Add to List" on the movie profile will save that movie to the user's watchlist, which can be accessed in the "Your Movies" tab. Users can view a movie's profile and delete a movie from this page, as well.
